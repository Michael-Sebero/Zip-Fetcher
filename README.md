## Purpose

To provide directory patches to a Minecraft instance automatically via the contents of a `.zip` or `.7z` file.


## How to Use

* Once you install the mod a file will be created inside your Minecraft directory called 
`zipfetcher.properties` add your URL which contains the archive and the mod will fetch & extract it where the configuration file is located `/minecraft/zipfetcher.properties/`.

* Launch the game and the mod will start downloading and extracting the archive, then the mod will delete the archive, itself and exit the game.

* Upon next launch your Minecraft instance is now patched.


## Security Statement

**Archives can't be extracted outside the Minecraft instance and the download section by default is empty.**
